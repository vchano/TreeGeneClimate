# Exome Capture Sequencing

This repository includes scripts used for the analysis of exome capature sequencing:

1. Quality check by means of FASTQC 
2. Adapters trimming using TRIMMOMATICS, and QC of trimmed reads
3. Mapping with Bowtie2, and processing files (sorting, deduplication...)
4. Coverage metrics
5. Variant calling with bcftools mpileup and call, filtering, and basic metrics

**NOTE:** The repository is still under construction
